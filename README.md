## Project 1 (Supervised Learning): 
Finding Donors for CharityML 

## Project 2 (Deep Learning): 
Develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.


## Project 3 (Unsupervised Learning): 
Apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
